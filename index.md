## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Data Science at Fudan University. Prior to Fudan, I was a postdoctoral research associate joint appointed by the ISEN department and TAMIDS at Texas A&M University. I got my Ph.D. in operations research from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interests lie in simulation optimization, kernel methods, and statistical learning.
